## Exercise 1: French Roulette

- Don't worry! You're on the right homework! This is Homework 02. We just really like playing roulette.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("http://cdn-blog-assets.bigfishgames.com/uploads/2013/11/6-4-European-Roulette.png")
```

- A French roulette has:
  - **37 colored and numbered pockets** on the wheel.
  - 0 is <span style="color:green">green</span>.
  - In number ranges from 1 to 10 and 19 to 28: 
    - Odd numbers are <span style="color:red">red</span>.
    - Even numbers are <span style="color:black">black</span>.
  - In ranges from 11 to 18 and 29 to 36:
    - Odd numbers are <span style="color:black">black</span>.
    - Even numbers are <span style="color:red">red</span>.

**TASKS**:

- **(a)** (3 points) Read the data in `roulette.csv` file from the URL: https://nkha149.github.io/stat385-sp2020/files/data/roulette.csv and stores the data as a data frame named `wheel`.
  - Your data frame should look like this if you correctly import the data:

```{r}
# import the data
wheel <- read.csv('https://nkha149.github.io/stat385-sp2020/files/data/roulette.csv')
```

- **(b)** (12 points) Write an R function named `roulette()` that simulate a roulette, that is it has:
  - **Input**: 2 arguments `bet` and `amount`
    - `bet`: argument that takes one of the following options:
      - `low`(1-18) or `high` (19-36): A bet that the number will be in the chosen range.
      - `red` or `black`: A bet that the number will be the chosen color.
      - `even` or `odd`: A bet that the number will be of the chosen type.
      - `first` or `second` or `third`: A bet that the number will be in the chosen dozen: first (1-12), second (13-24), or third (25-36).
      - any number from 0 to 36.
    - `amount`: amount in dollars that you want to bet on. The default value for `amount` is `1`.
  - **Output**:
    - The amount of money you gain/lose after the bet.
      - `-amount` if you lose the bet.
      - The amount of money win is calculated following the table below.
      - Make sure to include the `$` dollar sign.

  - Examples:
    - Ha bets on `red` with $10. If she wins, her gain amount will be $10 (1 to 1 payout rate).
    - Ha bets on `5` with $1. If she wins, her gain amount will be $36 (36 to 1 payout rate).
    - Ha bets on `low` with $15. If she loses, her lose amount will be -$15. :(
    
```{r}
# your function
roulette <- function(bet, amount) {
  if (missing(amount)) {
    amount <- 1
  }
  correct <- sample(0:36, 1)
  red <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36)
  black <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35)
  even <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36)
  odd <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33,35)
  if (bet == correct) {
    winning<-paste0("$",36*amount)
    return(noquote(winning))
  }

    winning<-paste0("$",amount)
    return(noquote(winning))
    } 
  else if ((bet == 'high') && (correct > 18)) {
    winning<-paste0("$",amount)
    return(noquote(winning))
  } 
  else if((bet == 'red') && (correct %in% red)) {
    winning<-paste0("$",amount)

    return(noquote(winning))
  } 
  else if((bet == 'odd') && (correct %in% odd)) {
    winning<-paste0("$",amount)
    return(noquote(winning))
  } 
  else if((bet == 'even') && (correct %in% even)) {

```

- Use the following code to test your function. You should get the exact same outputs as shown.
  - Remove `eval=FALSE` in each chunk.

```{r}
set.seed(385)
roulette(bet = "red", amount = 10)
```

```{r}
set.seed(385)
roulette(bet = "first", amount = 15)
```

```{r}
set.seed(385)
roulette(bet = "odd", amount = 20)
```

```{r}
set.seed(385)
roulette(bet = 9, amount = 10)
```

```{r}
set.seed(385)
roulette(bet = 5)
```

## Exercise 2: Simulations and Graphing

- **(a)** (5 points) Modify function `roulette()` so that now it can only print out the amount of money lose/gain (e.g., 10, -10, 15, etc.) **without the dollar sign $**. Name this new function `roulette2()`.

```{r}
# your roulette2 function
roulette2 <- function(bet, amount) {
  if (missing(amount)) {
    amount <- 1
  }
  correct <- sample(0:36, 1)
  #correct <- 8
  red <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36)
  black <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35)
  even <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36)
  odd <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33,35)
  if (bet == correct) {
    return(36*amount)
  }
  else if((bet == "low") && (correct < 19)) {
    return(amount)
  } else if ((bet == 'high') && (correct > 18)) {
    return(amount)
  } else if((bet == 'red') && (correct %in% red)) {
    return(amount)
  } else if((bet == 'black') && (correct %in% black)) {
    return(amount)
  } else if((bet == 'odd') && (correct %in% odd)) {
    return(amount)
  } else if((bet == 'even') && (correct %in% even)) {
    return(amount)
  } else if((bet == 'first') && (correct %in% 1:12)) {
    return(2*amount)
  } else if((bet == 'second') && (correct %in% 13:24)) {
    return(2*amount)
  } else if((bet == 'third') && (correct %in% 25:36)) {
    return(2*amount)
  }
  else {
    return(-amount)
  }
}
```

- Use the following code to test your function. You should get the exact same outputs as shown.
  - Remove `eval=FALSE` in each chunk.

```{r}
set.seed(385)
roulette2(bet = "red", amount = 10)
```

```{r}
set.seed(385)
roulette2(bet = "first", amount = 15)
```

```{r}
set.seed(385)
roulette2(bet = "odd", amount = 20)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(385)
roulette2(bet = 9, amount = 10)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(385)
roulette2(bet = 5)
```

- **(b)** (5 points) We want to estimate the **probability of winning if we keep betting on `red`**. To do that, we use simulation studies, that is running the `roulette2()` function many many times and record the number of times we win (not have a negative total amount at the end of the game). The number of simulations $n$ is 5000.
  
```{r}
set.seed(385)
i <- c(1:5000)
count <- 0
for(x in i) {
  if (roulette2(bet = "red") > 0) {
    count = count + 1
  }
}
print(count/5000)
```

- **(c)** (5 points) Similarly, we want estimate the **probability of winning if we keep betting on the `first` dozen**. The number of simulations $n$ is 5000.

```{r}
set.seed(385)
i <- c(1:5000)
count <- 0
for(x in i) {
  if (roulette2(bet = "first") > 0) {
    count = count + 1
  }
}
```

- **(d)** (5 points) Now, we want to estimate the **expected value of amount of money we will have by the end of the game if we bet on `odd` with $5**. In this example, the number of simulations is 7500.

```{r}
set.seed(385)
i <- c(1:7500)
count <- 0
for(x in i) {
  count = count + (roulette2(bet = "odd", 5))
}
print(count/7500)
```

## Exercise 3: Iris Flower Dataset

- **(a)** (5 points) Plot the histogram of the `Sepal.Length` of all three types of the Iris flowers.

```{r fig.align='center'}
# plot histogram
Sepal_Length <- iris[["Sepal.Length"]]
hist(Sepal_Length)
```


- **(b)** (5 points) Plot a scatterplot of the `Sepal.Length` (x-axis) and the `Sepal.Width` (y-axis) of all three types of the Iris flowers.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
# plot scatterplot
x <- iris[["Sepal.Length"]]
y <- iris[["Sepal.Width"]]
plot(x,y)
```


- **(c)** (5 points) Same as part (b) but now color the points depending on their `Species`. That is,
  - If the flower is `setosa`, color of the point is `green` (or other color).
  - If the flower is `versicolor`, the color of the point is `red` (or other color).
  - If the flower is `virginica`, the color of the point is `blue` (or other color).

- Your plot should look something like this:

```{r, fig.align='center'}
# plot scatterplot with colors
plot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Sepal.Width, pch = 21, bg = c("red", "blue", "green"))
```
