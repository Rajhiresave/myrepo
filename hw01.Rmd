## Exercise 1: French Roulette

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("http://cdn-blog-assets.bigfishgames.com/uploads/2013/11/6-4-European-Roulette.png")
```

- A French roulette has:
  - **37 colored and numbered pockets** on the wheel.
  - 0 is <span style="color:green">green</span>.
  - In number ranges from 1 to 10 and 19 to 28: 
    - Odd numbers are <span style="color:red">red</span>.
    - Even numbers are <span style="color:black">black</span>.
  - In ranges from 11 to 18 and 29 to 36:
    - Odd numbers are <span style="color:black">black</span>.
    - Even numbers are <span style="color:red">red</span>.

**TASKS**:

- **(a)** (5 points) Read the data in `roulette.csv` file from the URL: https://nkha149.github.io/stat385-sp2020/files/data/roulette.csv and stores the data as a data frame named `wheel`.
  - Your data frame should look like this if you correctly import the data:

```{r}
# import the data here
wheel <- read.csv(file = 'https://nkha149.github.io/stat385-sp2020/files/data/roulette.csv')
```

- **(b)** (5 points) Write an R function named `roulette()` that simulate a roulette, that is it has:
  - **Input**:
    - `bet`: argument that takes exactly 1 number from `0:36`.
    - If no value is given for the argument, the **default value for `bet` is 14**.
  - **Output**:
    - Whether the input bet wins (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
  - Your function should print out the exact same output as shown when running the following code segment:
  
```{r}
# write your function here
roulette <- function(bet) {
  if (missing(bet)) {
    bet <- 14
  }
  correct <- sample(0:36, 1)
  if (correct == bet) {
    return (TRUE)
  } else {
    return (FALSE)
  }
}
```

  - After finish writing your function, remove the `eval=FALSE` option in the chunk below to test your function.

```{r}
set.seed(385)
roulette(bet = 10)

set.seed(385)
roulette()

set.seed(385)
roulette(bet = 5)

set.seed(420)
roulette(bet = 4)

set.seed(400)
roulette(bet = 36)
```

## Exercise 2: Number of Mortgage Payments

Consider the following formula to calculate the number of mortgage payment terms:

$$ n = \frac{ln \left( \frac{r}{\frac{m}{p} - r} + 1 \right)}{ln(1 + r)}$$

In the above formula, $m$ represents the monthly payment amount, $p$ is the principle, and $r$ is the (monthly) interest rate.

**TASK:** (5 points) Write an R function named `mortgage_num()` that calculates the number of mortgage payment terms using the above formula given $m$, $p$, and $r$.

That is, the function `mortgage_num()` has:

- **Input**:
  - `m`: the monthly payment amount.
  - `p`: the principle.
  - `r`: the monthly interest rate.
- **Output**:
  - a **whole number** representing the number of mortgage payment terms calculated using the formula.
  - **always** take the [ceiling of n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions), $\lceil n \rceil$ and print out the whole number as the function output.
  - for example, using the formula with $m$ = 2000, $p$ = 200000, $r$ = 0.005, $n$ = 138.9757. We will round this up and return 139.
- Your function should print out the exact same output as shown when running the following code segment:
  
```{r}
# write your function here
mortgage_num <- function(m,p,r) {
  smallDenom <- (m/p) - r 
  num <- log(r/(smallDenom)+1)
  denom = log(1+r)
  n <- ceiling(num/denom)
  return (n)
}
```

- Again, remove `eval=FALSE` in the chunk below to test your code:

```{r eval}
mortgage_num(m = 2000, p = 200000, r = 0.005)
mortgage_num(m = 1800, p = 200000, r = 0.005)
mortgage_num(m = 1500, p = 200000, r = 0.005)
```

## Exercise 3: Iris Flower Dataset

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Irises-Vincent_van_Gogh.jpg/785px-Irises-Vincent_van_Gogh.jpg")
```


The [Iris flower dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset) is one of the most well-known datasets in the data science world. For this exercise, we will take a quick look at this famous dataset. The `iris` dataset has already been loaded to R as a data frame called `iris`.

Type `iris` in your console window in RStudio to take a quick look at it.

**TASKS**: (10 points)

- **(a)** (1 point) Get the dimension (number of rows, number of columns) of the `iris` data frame.

```{r}
# dimensions of iris
ncol(iris)
nrow(iris)
```

- **(b)** (1 point) Print out the first 6 rows of `iris`.

```{r}
# first 6 rows of iris
head(iris, n = 6)
```


- **(c)** (2 points) Compute the **average** of Sepal Length for Virginica Iris flowers only.

```{r}
# compute the average
tab <- iris[iris$Species == 'virginica', ]
mean(tab[["Sepal.Length"]])
```

- **(d)** (2 points) Similar to (c), we can also select only the Versicolor Iris flowers. Compute the **standard deviation** of the Petal Length for Versicolor Iris flowers only.

```{r}
# compute the standard deviation
tab2 <- iris[iris$Species == 'versicolor', ] 
sd(tab2[["Petal.Length"]])
```

- **(e)** (2 points) Compute the **median** of the Sepal Width for Setosa Iris flowers only.

```{r}
# compute the median
tab3 <- iris[iris$Species == 'setosa', ] 
median(tab3[["Sepal.Width"]])
```

- **(f)** (2 points) In this dataset, how many rows are Setosa Iris flowers?

```{r}
# number of rows that are Setosa Iris flowers
nrow(tab3)
```

## Exercise 4: Coronavirus

The coronavirus has been on the news over the past weeks. We will take a look at the data on this newly discovered virus. This dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/brendaso/2019-coronavirus-dataset-01212020-01262020). The dataset contains the coronavirus cases recorded up to 01/26/2020. The `Confirmed` column represents the **cummulative** number of cases confirmed at the that day and time. For example, up to 1/26/2020 11:00 AM, there are 40 confirmed cases in Shanghai, China.

**TASKS**:

- **(a)** (5 points) Read the data in `coronavirus-2020-01-26.csv` file from the URL: https://nkha149.github.io/stat385-sp2020/files/data/coronavirus-2020-01-26.csv and stores the data as a data frame named `coronavirus`.
  - After loading the data, take a quick look at the dataset using the `str()` function.

```{r echo=FALSE}
coronavirus <- read.csv("https://nkha149.github.io/stat385-sp2020/files/data/coronavirus-2020-01-26.csv")
str(coronavirus)
```

- To select only data for the United States, we can use the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
coronavirus[coronavirus$Country == "United States", ]
```

- **(b)** (5 points) Follow the syntax in the code shown above, print out the lastest data on **confirmed** cases of the coronavirus.
  - Those are the rows that have `Data.last.updated` equals to `1/26/2020 11:00 AM`.
  - Only print out the following columns: `Province.State`, `Country`, `Date.last.updated`, and `Confirmed`.

```{r}
# filter data
coron <- coronavirus[coronavirus$Date.last.updated == '1/26/2020 11:00 AM', 2:5] 
str(coron)
```
